## Task
Create a program that will allow a user to enter a string of characters and numbers and will return a string that is reversed.
I.E if the user enters “Hello” the program should return “olleH”

#### Rules
You can use any language you like and you can use any libraries to create the interface and anything else. The only thing you cannot use is a premade function to actually reverse the string (for example if using PHP you can’t use the strrev() function) this function must be written by you. Please comment this function well and explain your thought process.

#### Scope and Marking
The program should be able to take large strings consisting of thousands of characters.
You will be marked on:
Efficiency and speed of operation
User friendliness
Code format and comments
Documentation
